# Rewaa Web
This is hiring assignment for Rewaa Technologies.

Implement a simple full-stack inventory management application as a SPA (Single Page Application) based on Angular and NodeJs. You need to create two different projects for that; Frontend and Backend.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## User Cases Covered
